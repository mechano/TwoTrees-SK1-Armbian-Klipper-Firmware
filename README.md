The firmware has Klipper 0.13. 

The screen works with Tortillery project for Artillery Sidewinder X4 printer and is in vertical position, sorry but I'm still dealing to make one specific for SK1.

If you don't like the vertical screen , don't use it and revert to other projects like the CYD-Klipper screen.
